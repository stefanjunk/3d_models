# Retrospective 3D-design preflight — Permanent One Off City Map Wall Relief

`Permanent One Off City Map Wall Relief | C2 (31.5/100) | R0 | K2 | Lane E | LOW_UNKNOWN`

## Decision

- Release: `HOLD`
- Lane: `E`
- Rationale: The retrospective preflight blocks release wherever interface evidence, the exact manufacturing profile, lifecycle controls, or measurable verification remains incomplete.
- Purpose: A unique permanent 600 x 400 mm Berlin street-map wall artwork printed as two 300 x 400 mm four-color halves on the Anycubic Kobra 3 Max Combo. The halves are permanently registered and bonded into one non-serviceable picture. Local rear seam keys and isolated hanger/standoff blocks provide assembly and an 18 mm halo cavity without a rear grid. Selected abstract paths pass optional customer-added light through the visible face.

This is a retrospective backfill of the currently evidenced repository state.
Unknown facts were not reconstructed or inferred as measurements.

## Complexity score rationale

| Dimension | Score | Evidence-based rationale |
|---|---:|---|
| REQ | 0 | A design specification or requirement record exists, but release criteria may still be incomplete. |
| CTX | 0 | The documented use is a narrow decorative or static context. |
| PAR | 1 | The current evidence exposes approximately 0 distinct geometry-file stems; exports may duplicate physical parts. |
| INT | 2 | At least one functional host, human, medium, or assembly boundary governs success. |
| CPL | 0 | The available architecture appears locally coupled or monolithic. |
| MOT | 0 | The primary product state is static apart from assembly handling. |
| GEO | 2 | Geometry appears conventional or non-fit-critical, although exact dimensions were not re-derived. |
| PHY | 2 | Load, heat, airflow, water, fatigue, or another functional physical domain must be tested. |
| MAT | 1 | A conventional single-material FDM route is sufficient at the documented level. |
| EXT | 3 | Purchased hardware, printer equipment, electronics, or software participates in the system. |
| VER | 2 | Several fit, function, flow, load, motion, or process checks are required. |

## Readiness

| Component | Level |
|---|---|
| scope_variant | R3 |
| requirements | R2 |
| critical_interfaces | R2 |
| manufacturing_profile | R0 |
| verification | R2 |

Blocking unknowns:

- variant-confirmed critical interface dimensions, tolerances, and uncertainty
- complete printer/material/nozzle/orientation/process-profile set
- measurable acceptance criteria
- verification plan and physical result references

## Criticality

`K2` — The product involves load, flow, motion, heat-adjacent use, or direct body contact and therefore requires controlled functional testing.

Credible effects: functional failure, leakage, obstruction, or detachment, minor injury or property damage.

## Interface register

| Contract | Interface | Evidence | Criticality | Verification |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `IF-ENV-GEO-SUP-PLN-001` | Printed product to display or use surface | E0 | K2 | PLANNED |

The JSON contract records the primary discovered boundary. Because the audit
does not prove complete interface discovery, G1/G2 remain conservative.

## Hard gates

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| G0 | PASS |
| G1 | PASS |
| G2 | FAIL |
| G3 | FAIL |
| G4 | FAIL |
| G5 | PASS |
| G6 | PASS |

## Warnings

- `CRITICAL_INTERFACE_UNKNOWN` (BLOCKER): The primary functional interface lacks variant-confirmed dimensions, tolerance, and uncertainty evidence.
- `VERIFICATION_NOT_DEFINED` (BLOCKER): Printer, material, nozzle, orientation, and process profile are not documented as one complete exact set.

## Functional FMEA

| Failure | Local/final effect | Detection | Mitigation | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary interface misses fit or functional intent | Loss of function; consequences listed under criticality | Variant measurement, coupon, and controlled prototype inspection | Confirm host/variant, tolerance, uncertainty, keep-outs, and stop conditions | Coupon/prototype test; expert review for K3/K4 |

## Next evidence

1. Confirm the exact product/host variant and complete the primary interface contract. Exit: Datums, nominal dimensions, tolerances, measurement uncertainty, keep-outs, and variant identity are recorded from traceable evidence.
2. Record the exact manufacturing profile. Exit: Printer, material, nozzle, orientation, and complete process profile are uniquely identified and source-linked.
3. Define measurable acceptance criteria and a minimal coupon/prototype test. Exit: Each critical interface and credible failure mode has a method, threshold, and result-record location.
