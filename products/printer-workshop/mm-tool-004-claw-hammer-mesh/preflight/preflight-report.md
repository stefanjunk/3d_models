# Retrospective 3D-design preflight — Mm Tool 004 Claw Hammer Mesh

`Mm Tool 004 Claw Hammer Mesh | C3 (57.8/100) | R1 | K0 | Lane E | LOW_UNKNOWN`

## Decision

- Release: `HOLD`
- Lane: `E`
- Rationale: The retrospective preflight blocks release wherever interface evidence, the exact manufacturing profile, lifecycle controls, or measurable verification remains incomplete.
- Purpose: Provide a claw-hammer-shaped printable reference or display mesh; it is not validated for striking or load-bearing tool use.

This is a retrospective backfill of the currently evidenced repository state.
Unknown facts were not reconstructed or inferred as measurements.

## Complexity score rationale

| Dimension | Score | Evidence-based rationale |
|---|---:|---|
| REQ | 2 | Only product-level intent and artifact names are available; quantified requirements are incomplete. |
| CTX | 2 | The use context includes a host, environment, or user variant that must be confirmed. |
| PAR | 2 | The current evidence exposes approximately 1 distinct geometry-file stems; exports may duplicate physical parts. |
| INT | 3 | At least one functional host, human, medium, or assembly boundary governs success. |
| CPL | 2 | Changes can propagate across multiple parts, datums, or functional subsystems. |
| MOT | 1 | The primary product state is static apart from assembly handling. |
| GEO | 3 | Freeform, organic, hidden, thin, or reconstructed geometry is present or implied. |
| PHY | 2 | Load, heat, airflow, water, fatigue, or another functional physical domain must be tested. |
| MAT | 2 | Material behavior, anisotropy, flexibility, surface process, or post-processing affects function. |
| EXT | 3 | Purchased hardware, printer equipment, electronics, or software participates in the system. |
| VER | 3 | Several fit, function, flow, load, motion, or process checks are required. |

## Readiness

| Component | Level |
|---|---|
| scope_variant | R1 |
| requirements | R1 |
| critical_interfaces | R1 |
| manufacturing_profile | R1 |
| verification | R1 |

Blocking unknowns:

- stable current product revision
- variant-confirmed critical interface dimensions, tolerances, and uncertainty
- complete printer/material/nozzle/orientation/process-profile set
- measurable acceptance criteria
- verification plan and physical result references

## Criticality

`K0` — The documented scope is decorative/display-only; failure primarily wastes a print or degrades appearance.

Credible effects: cosmetic dissatisfaction, wasted print.

## Interface register

| Contract | Interface | Evidence | Criticality | Verification |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `IF-EXT-GEO-CON-MIXED-001` | Printed product to intended host | E1 | K0 | PLANNED |

The JSON contract records the primary discovered boundary. Because the audit
does not prove complete interface discovery, G1/G2 remain conservative.

## Hard gates

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| G0 | WARN |
| G1 | WARN |
| G2 | PASS |
| G3 | FAIL |
| G4 | FAIL |
| G5 | PASS |
| G6 | WARN |

## Warnings

- `VARIANT_UNKNOWN` (WARN): No stable current product revision is evidenced at the product boundary.
- `VERIFICATION_NOT_DEFINED` (BLOCKER): Printer, material, nozzle, orientation, and process profile are not documented as one complete exact set.

## Next evidence

1. Confirm the exact product/host variant and complete the primary interface contract. Exit: Datums, nominal dimensions, tolerances, measurement uncertainty, keep-outs, and variant identity are recorded from traceable evidence.
2. Record the exact manufacturing profile. Exit: Printer, material, nozzle, orientation, and complete process profile are uniquely identified and source-linked.
3. Define measurable acceptance criteria and a minimal coupon/prototype test. Exit: Each critical interface and credible failure mode has a method, threshold, and result-record location.
